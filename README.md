# S.M. - TASK

## To do
1. “Implement a library providing SortedLinkedList
   (linked list that keeps values sorted). It should be
   able to hold string or int values, but not both. Try to
   think about what you'd expect from such library as a
   user in terms of usability and best practices, and apply those.”

## How to test
1. Run `composer install`
2. Run `vendor/bin/phpunit tests`
